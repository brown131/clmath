This is a modern re-packaging of an old Common Lisp scientific library by Gerald Roylance.  I have found it to be a light-weight alternative to the GSL for my own purposes. (I was unable to get GSLL to even compile.)

* I built this using SBCL 1.0.55.0-abb03f9 on OS X 10.8.2.

* I am submitting this "as-is" and make no claims as it its accuracy or stability. 

* Please note, that this code is copyrighted by its owner, whom I have been unable to contact. I have made no changes to the code other than for repackaging, i.e. so that it builds using ASDF. I have also eliminated some references to obsolete CL implementations (MACLISP, etc.). The logic of the functions remains the same.
